    - B. Probably Yes  
    - C. Not Sure  
    - D. Probably Not  
    - E. Absolutely Not
    - Any comments? __________________
   
8.	If there is an automated tool that can predict CI build outcomes (i.e., either passed or failed) 
without running builds (i.e., a project is built only when the predicted build outcome is failed), 
do you think it would be useful for CI-based software development?
    - A. Absolutely Yes
    - B. Probably Yes
    - C. Not Sure
    - D. Probably Not
    - E. Absolutely Not
    - Any comments? __________________
   
9. Why do you think CI build outcome prediction would be useful?
     - A. Obtain quick feedback of CI builds
     - B. Save time overhead of CI builds
     - C. Reduce resource consumption in CI servers
     - D. Accelerate software development
     - E. Others __________________
   
10. Why do you think CI build outcome prediction would not be useful?
    - A. Lack of prediction accuracy 
    - B. Lack of explainability
    - C. Incorrect prediction may delay the discovery of bugs (e.g., compilation error or test failure) 
    - D. Incorrect prediction may increase the difficulty of bug fixing
    - E. Others __________________
